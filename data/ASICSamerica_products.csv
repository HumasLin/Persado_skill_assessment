To bring even more fun and excitement to GEL-CUMULUS® 23 this season, we spent some time daydreaming about summer. It’s all about bringing family and friends together, enjoying some sunshine, and firing up the grill. We’ve got all the hits of a summer cookout grilled into these shoes - hot dogs, cheeseburgers, veggie patties, watermelon, popsicles and more. The GEL-CUMULUS® 23 shoe's focus is to provide an even smoother and softer ride while implementing gender tailored technology in the men's and women's models. Continuing to draw inspiration from cumulus clouds, we reimagined this neutral running shoe's upper and midsole formation by applying a more holistic design approach that adapts to the runner's anatomy in motion. Wrapping the foot with an even softer feel, the engineered mesh upper adds strategic support in targeted areas while leaving some of the fibers more open to improve breathability. The upper also works more closely with the midsole's movement, which creates a smoother stride from footstrike to toe-off. Additionally, the shoe's upper is made with recycled materials to reduce waste and carbon emissions. To improve cushioning and flexibility, we added a 3D SPACE CONSTRUCTION™ to the top layer of the midsole. This technology is implemented through a series of strategically planted pillars within the midsole, allowing runners to experience more compression in a specific area without reducing durability or stability. These pillar formations are tuned differently in the men's and women's models to address each gender's biomechanical data. By helping runners appropriately compress the foam during the landing phase of their stride, this shoe promotes a smoother ride and improves shock absorption. Lastly, a softer GEL® technology unit is positioned under the heel to improve cushioning while the FLYTEFOAM® midsole material helps create a smoother and more supportive ride.

Whether it's tempo runs, long runs, or racing, the EVORIDE™ 2 shoe is built for neutral and supinated runners focused on conserving energy. Our intent with the second iteration of this series was to preserve the shoe's easy forward rolling properties while reducing the overall weight and softening the cushioning underfoot. Additionally, the shoe's engineered mesh upper is designed with a multi-directional stretch mesh that adjusts better to the foot's natural shape. The shoe's upper is also made with recycled materials, while the sockliner is produced with a solution dyeing process that reduces carbon emissions and water usage. This neutral running style is built on the METARIDE™ shoe philosophy, which aims to lessen the overall load via its curved sole. These elements increase running efficiency, which helps runners feel fresher for longer durations. Designed to create a comfortable ride, the shoe's midsole incorporates FLYTEFOAM® technology, which gives the runner a lightweight feel and more cushioning across longer distances. Lastly, the outsole also features AHARPLUS™ technology that's strategically positioned in higher contact areas to improve the shoe's durability.
